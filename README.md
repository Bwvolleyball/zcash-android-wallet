# zcash-android-wallet
An Android wallet using the Zcash Android SDK that is maintained by ECC developers.

### Motivation
[Dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) - _transitive verb_ -  is the practice of an organization using its own product. This app was created to help us learn. 

Please take note: the wallet is not an official product by ECC, but rather a tool for learning about our libraries that it is built on. This means that we do not have robust infrasturcture or user support for this application. We open sourced it as a resource to make wallet development easier for the Zcash ecosystem. 

# Disclaimers
There are some known areas for improvement:

- This app is mainly intended for learning and improving the related libraries that it uses. There may be bugs.
- Traffic analysis, like in other cryptocurrency wallets, can leak some privacy of the user.
- The wallet requires a trust in the server to display accurate transaction information. 

See the [Wallet App Threat Model](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/wallet_threat_model.html)
for more information about the security and privacy limitations of the wallet.
